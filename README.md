# GravitySim

## Overview

GravitySim is a simulation project aimed at modeling the interactions of celestial bodies in space. The simulation considers gravitational forces and offers a modular, extendable approach to add more features like collision detection, energy calculations, and more.

## Features

- Object-Oriented Design: Makes it easy to extend and maintain the code.
Efficient Algorithms: Uses optimized algorithms for gravitational calculations.

- NetCDF Integration: Outputs the simulation data in NetCDF format for easy post-processing.

- Energy Calculations: Calculates the kinetic and potential energy of celestial bodies.

## Dependencies
- C++11 or higher
- NetCDF C++ Library

## Installation
Clone the repository and build using the following commands:

bash```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GravitySim.git
cd GravitySim
make
```

## Usage
Run the simulation by executing:

bash ```
./GravitySim
```
